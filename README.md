# Test script
A language to write io test for your program.

## Building
Clone the repo and run `cargo build --release`.

## Usage
Run the program by either doing `cargo run -- [file name]` if you are in this repo or running the binary directly using `path/to/test_script [file name]`.

## Help
Read documentation.md and look at the examples. If you need help with using the interpreter, use `./test_script --help`.
